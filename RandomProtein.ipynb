        "  <li><h2>Randomized Group Selection</h2><p>Probably not the correct name for this, but this is in beta so we will worry about that later. Select Residues using the probabilities provided. For example, if <code>Percent_Polar</code> is set to <code>0.3</code>, then each residue will have a <code>30%</code> chance to be polar. Note that poor parameterization can result in this method never finding a solution</p></li> \n",
        "  <li><h2>Mutation -- Not implemented</h2><p>Begin with a random sequence. Each iteration will randomly select one residue that is causing distance from the desired output and mutate it into something that brings closer the desired results.</p></li>\n",
        "  <li><h2>Distribution -- Not implemented</h2><p>Select residues using a provided distribution. Note that this method will ignore checks to provided parameters, and instead only use the distributions provided.</p></li>\n",
        "  <li><h2>Builder</h2><p>Builds a protein from scratch to explicitly satisfy provided parameters. Not very fun, but it is the fastest by far and is honestly the most reliable method here. Adds residues to satisfy a probability parameter then moves to the next parameter. After this, the charged residues are flipped accordingly to get an exact specified charge. After this, the sequence is shuffled to give a random sequence. Awkward parameterization can result in an incorrect length or a very slight incorrect charge (+ or - 1)</p></li>\n",
